# Contributing to Commit-Craft

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Commit-Craft! Contributing to an open-source project is a fantastic way to learn, share knowledge, and build a community. Below are the guidelines to help you contribute effectively.

## How Can You Help?

### 1. Reporting Issues

If youâ€™ve found a bug, have an idea for a new feature, or noticed something that needs improvement, please report it in the [Issues]:(LINK_TO_ISSUES) section.

When reporting an issue, try to include:
- A detailed description of the problem.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
- Information about your environment (software version, operating system, etc.).

### 2. Proposing New Features

Would you like to add a new feature? You can also submit a proposal in the [Issues](https://github.com/KamilAdd-Byte/commit-craft/issues); section. Please include details such as:
- What value the feature will bring.
- Examples of how it might be used.

### 3. Creating Pull Requests

If youâ€™d like to make changes to the code directly, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository**:
   Click the "Fork" button at the top of the repository page.

2. **Clone the repository to your local machine**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KamilAdd-Byte/commit-craft.git
   ```

3. **Create a branch**:
   Before starting your work, create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <number-issue>feature-name
   ```

4. **Make your changes**:
   Edit the code, add new features, or fix bugs.

5. **Update the documentation**:
   Ensure that your changes are appropriately documented.

6. **Run tests**:
   Before submitting changes, verify that everything works correctly and that all tests pass.

7.  **Push your changes**:
    Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to format your commit messages. For example:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "[Number-issue]feat: add new feature description"
   git push origin <number-issue>feature-name
   ```

8. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**:
   Go to your forkâ€™s page and click "New Pull Request."

   When creating the PR:
   - Describe what you changed.
   - Explain why the changes are necessary.

## Code Guidelines

- Follow the [coding standard].
- Add comments to make the code more understandable.
- Write tests for new features.
- Avoid making large changes in a single PR; instead, split them into smaller parts.

## Communication

- If you have questions, you can post them in the [Discussions](https://github.com/KamilAdd-Byte/commit-craft/discussions) section or email us at [contact@example.com].

Thank you for your time and effort. Together, we can build something amazing! ðŸŽ‰
